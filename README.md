# 🎨 Coloring Book Generator 🖌️

Welcome to the magical world of the Coloring Book Generator! 🌈✨

## 🚀 What is this sorcery?

Imagine a world where boring, ordinary photos transform into enchanting coloring pages with just a wave of your digital wand! That's exactly what our Coloring Book Generator does. It's like having a tiny artist living inside your computer, ready to turn any image into a fun coloring adventure!

## 🧙‍♂️ Features that'll make you go "Wow!"

- 🖼️ **Image Transformation**: Watch in awe as your photos morph into line drawings!
- 🎭 **U2NET Magic**: We've harnessed the power of U2NET, a neural network so smart it could probably beat you at chess (if it played chess, that is).
- 🖱️ **User-Friendly GUI**: Even your grandma could use it! (No offense to tech-savvy grandmas out there)
- 🚄 **Lightning Fast**: Blink and you might miss it! (Okay, maybe not that fast, but pretty quick)
